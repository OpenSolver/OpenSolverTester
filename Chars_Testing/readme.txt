This macro is based on the testing suite developed by Andrew Mason, Jack Dunn
and byi649.

It attempts to complement the work done by Sam Gilmour in identifying 
special characters which cause errors in OpenSolver.

His work can be found here:
https://github.com/OpenSolver/OpenSolver/issues/268

It is hoped that future developers of OpenSolver will be able to use the
macro to more easily identify scenarios where special characters cause errors,
rather than manually trying to find these.
